{{ if .Values.archiving.enabled }}
Archiving is enabled and a MinIO cluster has been automatically started.
A bucket named "archive" has also been created for use with archiving.
To retrieve your Root Username and Password, run the following commands to retrieve them from the Kubernetes Secret.
To retrieve Root User: kubectl get secret --namespace default {{.Release.Name}}-minio -o jsonpath="{.data.root-user}" | base64 --decode
To retrieve Root Password: kubectl get secret --namespace default {{.Release.Name}}-minio -o jsonpath="{.data.root-password}" | base64 --decode

Ignore any trailing "%" signs.

An archive provider has been automatically created and set as the default archive provider for AMPS. If you would like to disable archiving at any point, head to System Configuration.

If you would like to access the MinIO UI, run the following command: 
kubectl port-forward svc/{{.Release.Name}}-minio 9001:9001
